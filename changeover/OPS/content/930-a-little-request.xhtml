    <h2>A little request</h2>
<p>Dear reader. If you liked the book, I kindly ask you to consider taking a minute to leave a review and tell me what you enjoyed the most. This helps me focus my future efforts and reach a wider audience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please, also consider joining my mailing list on <a href="https://rumpel-stiltskin.com">Rumpel-Stiltskin.com</a>. I often run free book giveaways as a thank-you to my readers. I promise not to spam you; scout’s honour.</p>
