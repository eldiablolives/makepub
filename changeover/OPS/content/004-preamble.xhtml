    <h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>This book contains strong language and a graphic depiction of sex with multiple consensual partners of adult age. If you are underage or such subjects offend you, please stop reading now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The book is self-edited into a reasonably cohesive story. It may contain errors, which will be fixed in further editions. Beyond that, it would require a professional editor, which, at the book’s price point, just isn’t economically viable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The author doesn’t condone actions, thoughts, or views expressed in this book. The book is for adult entertainment only. Any perceived underlying ideas, philosophical or political, stem from the reader’s imagination alone. This book is a satirical fantasy touching on serious issues, exaggerating them to absurdity, and criticising the result.</p>
