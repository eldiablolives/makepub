    <h2>Caution: Sensitive Content Ahead</h2>
<p>This work of fiction explores the nature of power, sexuality, gender ideology, and government overreach, adopting a particularly strong contrarian view of the rapidly changing social and political landscape to amplify tension. The narrative presents a single-sided view, which some readers may find troubling, intentionally making few attempts to provide a balanced perspective in order to create a more polarising protagonist. Reader discretion is advised.</p>
