    <h2>Caution: Sensitive Content Ahead</h2>
<p>This work of fiction deals with sensitive themes. It delves into the the nature of sexuality, gender ideology, and government overreach, taking particularly strong contrarian view of rapidly changing social and societal landscape while amplifying the tension. This narrative presents particularly single-sided view which some may find disturbing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Reader discretion is advised. Those easily offended by such depictions should stop reading now. This book is not a treatise on social or political mores but a fictional account of a “colourful,” conflicted character lashing out from feeling betrayed and marginalised. Few attempts were made to provide a more balanced view in order to create a conflicted and more impactful protagonist.</p>
