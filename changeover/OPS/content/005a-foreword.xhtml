    <h2>Foreword</h2>
<p>This is a fictional account inspired by real events, a real journey of a man I met turned into a fantastic tale. Most characters are based on real people whose names were changed to protect their identities. Some events are purely fictional, some exaggerated, and others added to fit into the existing lore and universe of my other stories. I tried to keep to the original narrative as it was told to me, but I added more colour to the story to make it a more compelling read.</p>
